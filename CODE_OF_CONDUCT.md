# Code of Conduct

## On diversity

One of the great things about Free/Libre and Open Source Software is its
potential for diverse participation: all you need is a computer, an internet
connection, a chunk of free time and the desire to do something.

A further advantage of the FLOSS model is software can be modified to meet the
needs of underrepresented groups. These might otherwise not have enough
critical mass to convince the producers of proprietary software to cater to
them, and with FLOSS should be able to take matters into their own hands.

So far we have only scratched the surface of this potential.

## On governance

Notion is a relatively small community. At this scale it doesn't seem worth it
yet to set up a governance structure as found in larger communities, so until
then, raboof is acting as the BDFN: "Benevolent Dictator For Now".
We will revisit this choice when the community grows.

## On conduct

We welcome all communication, even heated and direct debate, as long as it is
respectful to all involved. If anyone feels unwelcome, disrespected or even
threatened by someone else's behaviour, this means we have something to
improve. The emphasis should not be on punishing bad behaviour, but on finding
ways to take better consideration of each other going forward.

If you feel uncomfortable voicing concerns around conduct publically, feel free
to contact raboof. He promises to treat such issues with respect and privacy,
and work with you and any others to find a way to resolve the situation.
If this contact point does not work for you we unfortunately don't have any
alternatives available at this time.

Ultimately, when a participant appears unwilling or unable to adjust his
conduct to a reasonable degree, we will have no choice but to ban that user
from the project. Luckily this has never been necessary so far.
