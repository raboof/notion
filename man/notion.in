.SH BASIC CONCEPTS

This section is an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
display managed by Notion and their relationships in a standard setup. This
information is necessary to understand the operations and availability
of the different key bindings explained below. For a more detailed 
explanation, needed for writing custom bindings configuration files,
see the additional documentation available from the Notion Web page.

The top-level objects that matter in the case at hand are \fBscreens\fP.
They correspond to physical screens. Screens contain \fBworkspaces\fP
(which are a kind of \fBgroup\fP), and \fBclient windows\fP put into full
screen mode. These objects are \fBmultiplexed\fP in the sense that only
one can be displayed at a time.

Workspaces themselves may contain \fBtilings\fP and detached/floating
\fBframes\fP. A workspace containing no tilings and only detached/floating
windows is also called a \fBfloating workspace\fP. Tilings themselves contain 
\fBframes\fP tiled to fill the screen, and possibly a statusbar or dock. Akin 
to screens, frames multiplex other objects, but in this case mostly client 
window \fBgroups\fP. Most of the time, frames are the only trace of Notion 
you see on the screen. Frames may have border decorations, and they have a 
\fBtab\fP for each multiplexed object.

\fBQueries\fP are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens 
to ask you for textual input to execute an action that depends on it.
Most queries support tab-completion.


.SH BINDINGS

These are the default key and pointer bindings. (\fBMod1\fP) depends on your
system. On PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left Alt key
(\fBAlt_L\fP). On Suns it is usually bound to the diamond keys
(\fBMeta_L\fP, \fBMeta_R\fP). Use \fIxmodmap(1x)\fP to find out.

The string in square brackets after a binding group heading below indicates
the module that whose configuration file defines these bindings.

.SS Bindings operating on all frames

BINDINGS:WFrame

.SS Bindings operating on top-level (non-transient) frames and screens

BINDINGS:WMPlex.toplevel

.SS Bindings operating on top-level (non-transient) frames

BINDINGS:WFrame.toplevel

.SS Bindings for floating/detached frames

BINDINGS:WFrame.floating

.SS Bindings for tilings and tiled frames [mod_tiling]

These bindings are similar to those of the \fIjoe(1)\fP text editor.
Cut, copy and paste works in a more conventional manner, though, but
the keys are equivalent.
