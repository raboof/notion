default screen (root window), not all, as given by the -display option or
in the DISPLAY environment variable.

enable/disable (1/0) the use of it. The default is to use Xinerama
screen information.

.SH BASIC CONCEPTS

This section is an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
display managed by Ion and their relationships in a standard setup.
This information is necessary to understand the operations of different
key bindings. For a more detailed explanation, needed for writing
custom bindings configuration files, see the additional documentation
available from the Ion Web page.

The top-level objects that matter are screens and they correspond to
physical screens. Screens contain workspaces and client windows put in
full screen mode. Only one of these "multiplexed" objects can be viewed
at a time. 

Two types of workspaces currently supported; tiled (traditional Ion-style) 
and floating (PWM-style). Workspaces are not visible objects but rather 
collections of frames. Frames are the objects with decorations such as 
tabs and borders and there are two types of these corresponding to the
different types of workspaces.

Frames contain (multiplex) client windows, to each of which corresponds a
tab in the frame's decoration. Only one client window (or other object) 
can be shown at a time in each frame. (In a traditional window manager
each frame may contain exactly one client window.)

"Queries" are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens 
and are used to ask the user for textual input. Most queries support 
tab-completion.


.SH KEYS

These are the default key bindings.
.B Mod1
depends on your system. On PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left
Alt key (\fBAlt_L\fP).
On Suns it is usually bound to the diamond keys (\fBMeta_L\fP, \fBMeta_R\fP). Use
\fIxmodmap(1x)\fP to find out.

.SS F-keys

.TP
.B F1
Show manual page (query, uses ion-man). Tab-completion can be enabled by
specifying a list of directories in the variable query_man_path.
.TP
.B Mod1+F1
Show Ion manual page.
.TP
.B F2
Run an xterm.
.TP
.B F3
Run a program (query). Precede the program name with a colon (:) to run in xterm (ion-runinxterm).
.TP
.B Mod1+F3
Open a Lua code query. You can call all the functions listed in the
Ion configuration document (see section SEE ALSO) here. The 
variable "_" is bound to the frame in which the query was opened.
.TP
.B F4
Start new SSH session (query, uses ion-ssh). Hosts to tab-complete are
read from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
.TP
.B F5
Open a file for editing (query). Uses ion-edit which by default uses run-mailcap.
.TP
.B F6
Open a file for viewing (query). Uses ion-view which by default uses run-mailcap.
.TP
.B F9
Go to existing workspace or create new (query). If a non-existent
workspace was entered, the type of the workspace to be created will
be queried as well.
.TP
.B Mod1+F9
Create a new tiled workspace with name matching the type of
workspace to be created (the default_ws_type variable).

.SH POINTING DEVICE BUTTONS

The bindings for the two types of frames are again different because not
all legacy/floating frame actions are available on tiled frames and thus
those buttons have been mapped to other actions.

.B Button1 (left) on border
