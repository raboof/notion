NAME
       Ion - an X11 window manager

SYNOPSIS
       ion [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Ion  is  a tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users in
       mind.


OPTIONS
       -display host:display.screen
              X display to manage

       -cfgfile configfile
              Configuration file to use instead of default

       -moduledir dir
              Directory to search for module

       -confdir dir
              Directory to search for configuration files and other scripts

       -oneroot
              On X servers with multiple (traditional  non-Xinerama)  screens,
              manage  only  default screen (root window), not all, as given by
              the -display option or in the DISPLAY environment variable.

       -sessionname session_name
              Set session name. This option affects where workspace and  other
              save files are put (~/.ion2/session_name if option set).

       -xinerama 0|1
              If  Ion  was  compiled with Xinerama support, this option can be
              used to enable/disable (1/0) the use of it. The  default  is  to
              use Xinerama screen information.

       -i18n  Enable  use  of  multi-byte  string  routines,  actual  encoding
              depending on the locale.

       -help  Show help on command line options

       -version
              Show version

       -about Show about text (version, copyright)


BASIC CONCEPTS
       This section is an overview of the types objects that appear  on  an  X
       display  managed  by  Ion  and their relationships in a standard setup.
       This information is necessary to understand the operations of different
       key  bindings. For a more detailed explanation, needed for writing cus-
       tom bindings configuration  files,  see  the  additional  documentation
       available from the Ion Web page.

       The  top-level  objects  that matter are screens and they correspond to
       physical screens. Screens contain workspaces and client windows put  in
       full screen mode. Only one of these "multiplexed" objects can be viewed
       at a time.

       Two types of workspaces currently supported;  tiled  (traditional  Ion-
       style) and floating (PWM-style). Workspaces are not visible objects but
       rather collections of frames. Frames are the objects  with  decorations
       such as tabs and borders and there are two types of these corresponding
       to the different types of workspaces.

       Frames contain (multiplex) client windows, to each of which corresponds
       a  tab  in  the  frame's  decoration.  Only one client window (or other
       object) can be shown at a time in each frame. (In a traditional  window
       manager each frame may contain exactly one client window.)

       "Queries" are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames or screens and
       are used to ask the user for textual input. Most queries  support  tab-
       completion.



KEYS
       These  are  the  default key bindings.  Mod1 depends on your system. On
       PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left Alt key (Alt_L).  On
       Suns  it  is  usually  bound  to the diamond keys (Meta_L, Meta_R). Use
       xmodmap(1x) to find out.


   F-keys
       F1     Show manual page (query, uses ion-man).  Tab-completion  can  be
              enabled  by  specifying  a  list  of directories in the variable
              query_man_path.

       Mod1+F1
              Show Ion manual page.

       F2     Run an xterm.

       F3     Run a program (query). Precede the program name with a colon (:)
              to run in xterm (ion-runinxterm).

       Mod1+F3
              Open  a Lua code query. You can call all the functions listed in
              the Ion configuration document (see section SEE ALSO) here.  The
              variable  "_"  is  bound  to  the  frame  in which the query was
              opened.

       F4     Start new SSH session (query, uses ion-ssh). Hosts  to  tab-com-
              plete are read from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.

       F5     Open  a file for editing (query). Uses ion-edit which by default
              uses run-mailcap.

       F6     Open a file for viewing (query). Uses ion-view which by  default
              uses run-mailcap.

       F9     Go  to  existing workspace or create new (query). If a non-exis-
              tent workspace was entered, the type of the workspace to be cre-
              ated will be queried as well.

       Mod1+F9
              Create   a   new   workspace   (of   type  controlled  with  the
              default_ws_type variable) with a default name  formed  from  the
              type of the workspace.

LINE-EDITING KEYS
       These  keys  can be used in the line editor (queries). They are similar
       to those of the joe(1) editor.  Selection  works  differently,  though,
       while the keys are equivalent.

POINTING DEVICE BUTTONS
       The  bindings  for  the two types of frames are again different because
       not all legacy/floating frame actions are available on tiled frames and
       thus those buttons have been mapped to other actions.


   Tiled frames
       Button1 (left) or Button2 (middle) on tab
              Click: switch client, drag: drag&drop clients between frames

       Button1 (left) on border
              Drag: resize

       Mod1+Button1 (left) or Mod1+Button3 (right)
              Resize.

       Button3 (right) on tab
              Context menu


   Floating frames
       Button1 (left)
              Press:  raise frame, click tab: switch client, double-click tab:
              toggle shade mode, drag border:  resize,  drag  elsewhere:  move
              frame

       Button2 (middle) on tab
              Click: switch client, drag: drag&drop clients between frames

       Mod1+Button1 (left)
              Click: raise, drag: move

       Mod1+Button3 (right)
              Click: lower, drag: resize

       Button3 (right) on tab
              Context menu
