manager with only differences in default configuration files, configuration
file lookup paths and some options.

.SH BINDINGS

These are the default key and pointer bindings. (\fBMod1\fP) depends on your
system. On PC:s with XFree86 it is probably bound to the left Alt key
(\fBAlt_L\fP). On Suns it is usually bound to the diamond keys
(\fBMeta_L\fP, \fBMeta_R\fP). Use \fIxmodmap(1x)\fP to find out.

The string in square brackets after a binding group heading below indicates
the module that whose configuration file defines these bindings.
