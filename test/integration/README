Each subdirectory here is an integration test. 

== Requirements ==

- xserver-xorg-video-dummy 
- lposix (aka lua-posix in Debian)

== Running the tests ==

Install notion and run 'make test'

== How it works ==

Each integration test basically looks like this:
- Start a dummy X server (Xdummy)
- Start notion with the configuration in $test/config
  - basically $test/config behaves like the ~user/.notion dir for this test
  - Right now this starts the currenly *installed* notion.
    It would be better if it could start the version that was
    built but not neccessarily installed
- Execute each .lua script in $test
  - the .lua script is executed through notionflux, so:
    - it has access to the notion internals
    - I'm not sure whether it can 'require' stuff etc
  - scripts return "ok" upon success, an error message otherwise
  
== Limitations ==

- the x.org dummy driver does not appear to support RandR
- there might be some SELINUX noise, probably due to the way Xdummy works
- Xdummy doesn't properly autodetect which X ports are free, so we use a fixed
  value of :7
