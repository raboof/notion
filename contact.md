# Contact

There is a [mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/notion/mailman/notion-devel/)
on sourceforge, but ever since the project has migrated to github, it is no
longer very active.

We use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/raboof/notion/issues) and
pull requests for code contribution.

For discussion about the future of the project, we use issues tagged "enhancement".

For support questions and notion related chat such as quickly asking a question,
we use IRC:
#notion on Freenode ([Webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23notion)).

Please don't hesitate to get in touch, usually IRC is the easiest way.
