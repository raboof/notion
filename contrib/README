Installing and using a script

To use a script put them into your ~/.notion or your global notion directory and 
make sure you load the script with

dopath("scriptname")

in your cfg_notion.lua.


Statusbar scripts

Add the monitor(s) provided by the script into the template in cfg_statusbar.lua. Omit any "statusd_" prefixes of the monitor names.

Styles
