The original Ion was written and maintained by Tuomo Valkonen between 2003 and
2009, some parts date back to 1999.

After he stopped using Linux, Arnout Engelen took over the maintainership and
renamed Ion to Notion to conform to the Ion license, which did not allow for
the name Ion to be used by forks. The license has since been changed back to
the ordinary LGPL v2.1+ and code which was only available under the Ion license has been
replaced.

team". Please use "git blame" to identify precise authorship if you have to.
