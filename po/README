To generate the `ion3.pot` file needed for new translations, you
will need `lua-xgettext`, which you can download by executing

   darcs get http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/lua-xgettext/

Build and install it as instructed in its README. Then, `make pot`
in this directory, copy `ion3.pot` over as `$LANG.po`, and start
translating. To update/merge new strings to an existing translation,
run `make update_$LANG`, after you have first copy-pasted this
Makefile target, when it does not already exist.

Translations for the manual page and welcome message live in
`../man/`.
