These are some scripts and datafiles used for generating tables used in the
experimental UTF-8 implementation in xterm.

To run the convmap.pl script, you will need a copy of UnicodeData-Latest.txt
which is currently available as

         ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData-Latest.txt

It is a large file (~460kb), so it is not included in this distribution.

convmap.pl is used to generate ../keysym2ucs.c, e.g.,

	./convmap.plp >../keysym2ucs.c

keysym.map is input data for convmap.pl


The make-precompose.sh script makes the precompose.c file, which is used to
handle canonical composition. This also needs UnicodeData-Latest.txt. It uses
precompose.c.head and precompose.c.tail as templates.
