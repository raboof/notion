2002-04-05:
  * Resolved some problems with resize/workspace_request_sub_geom

2002-03-27:
  * Applied an input handling and resize mode patch.

2002-03-17:
  * Added 'split_top "dir"' command to create a new frame
    above/below/left of/right of all other frames
    (dir=top/bottom/left/right, respectively). Removed
    split_vert/horiz and replaced them with 'split "dir"'.  Also
    added 'split_empty "dir"' that will not attach current client to
    the newly created frame.

2002-03-16:
  * Added set_width/height/widthq/heightq commands. The versions with
    the q postfix take a value in [0,1] and the others take an
    integer value. The behaviour is obvious.

2002-02-06:
  * Fixed region_move_subregions so that destroy_frame should work
    now.

2002-01-30:
  * Transients fixed (at least partially).
  * Some focusing fixes.

2002-01-27:
  * Fixed some resize stuff. Simultaneous vertical and horizontal
    resize is now possible. Keyboard resize is not working yet:
    better "resize mode" binding handling wanted.
  * look-*.conf:s updated. 'frame_colors *, *, bg, *' and
    'background_color bg' have changed places. That is, the
    'background_color' option now sets the client area background
    while frame_colors sets the colours of the frame's border.
  * Some frame drawing changes.

2002-01-26:
  * Command sequences based on the query_function patch.
  * Support for deferred actions, deferred destroy particularly,
    called when the program returns to the main loop.
  * Added information about the 'warp_enabled' configuration file
    option to config.txt. The old CF_WARP and CF_WARP_WS compile-time
    options are gone. This option has the same effect as those two
    combined and _is enabled by default_.
  * Split stuff from config.txt and functions.txt to draw.txt and
    query.txt.
  * look-dusky.conf is now default.
  * Updated the LICENSE file to the clarified version of the artistic
    license. (The license used to be the original artistic license.)

2002-01-19:
  * Applied a patch to have query_function finally support functions
    with arguments.
  * Fixed a possible problem with missing configuration files.
  * Complain and refuse to start if configuration files are missing
    or bindings are inadequate (not the above fix :-). Also attempt
    to view this complaint with xmessage.

2002-01-12:
  * Installation prefix now (temporarily) defaults to
    /usr/local/ion-devel and configuration files will be expected to
    be found in this directory under etc/ion-devel or in
    ~/.ion-devel.

2001-12-29:
  * query_renameworkspace is back

2001-12-28:
  * Old confws.c updated to compile as a temporary (incomplete)
    implementation of workspace saving features

2001-08-28:
  * fit_clientwin changes

2001-08-19:
  * query/ compiles.

2001-08-12:
  * Added generic resize code

2001-08-08:
  * The generic window management library part, 'wmcore' is finally
    in compilable state again after having been fit to use abstract
    WRegions instead of specific frames, client windows, etc. where
    possible. It still needs much work, though.

2001-06-27:
  * Function list changes

2001-06-23:
  * look-*.confs updated
  * Makefile updates
  * sample.conf updates

2001-06-19:
  * Configuration file changes

2001-05-28:
  * Attach current client of a frame to the new frame when splitting.

2001-05-27:
  * New registration-based hooks and function list extensions.

2001-05-26:
  * Initial commit with wmcore/. Much more work still needed, though.

2001-04-25:
  * Added missing functions to documentation

2001-04-19:
  * switch_ws_next/prev wrap around
  * Fixed a problem with some programs' popups

2001-04-01:
  * Unmap;map race condition fix.

2001-03-12:
  * Added CALL_ALT and the 'add_clientwin_alt' alternative hook.
  * Hook changes

2001-03-05:
  * transient_mode winprop

2001-03-04:
  * Changes for easier completion support in modules

2001-03-03:
  * system.mk options to disable module support on systems without
    dynamic linking support and/or dlopen and friends.
  * Added read_config_for

2001-03-02:
  * Enhanced timer support
  * Added goto_client_name
  * Experimental module support

2001-02-26:
  * Completion fix (for the case where all possible completions are
    duplicates).

2001-02-24:
  * Added rename_workspace patch.
  * Oops kind of fix in key.c

2001-02-16:
  * complete_file_with_path fix and complete normally if no
    completions found in $PATH.

2001-02-15:
  * Some ICCCM and other fixes to make some programs not break as
    badly.
  * Call setpgid(0, 0) before running a program.
  * Oops. A few missing lines were causing bad things to happen when
    trying to resize only frame on a workspace.

2001-02-13:
  * Applied patch to allow command completion (using $PATH) with
    query_exec.

2001-02-12:
  * Destroying the first workspace on a screen could cause a
    segfault.

2001-01-21:
  * Added 'stubborn' winprop --- ignore coordinates --- for use with
    badly behaving windows when CF_PLACEMENT_GEOM is enabled.

2001-01-20:
  * Frame ID management fixes for multiple screens/broken workspace
    configuration files.
  * The functions 'goto_*_frame' changed to 'goto_*' --- check your
    bindings.

2001-01-16:
  * goto_previous fix
  * Other previous active window clean-up

2001-01-15:
  * Added CF_PLACEMENT_GEOM kludge --- Place new windows that have
    position specified in the frame under that coordinate.

2001-01-05:
  * 'query_runwith' runs the program without arguments if the user
    inputs an empty string.
  * 'query_workspace_with' didn't work after multihead update.
  * Trailing and leading whitespace of user input to queries are
    stripped.
  * Strip trailing and leading whitespace from window names.

2001-01-02:
  * Preliminary support for multiple screens within single process.
  * The command 'switch_ws_nth <num>' switches between workspaces of
    current screen. 'switch_ws_nth2 <scr>, <num>' can be used to go
    to specific, numbered workspace. Setting <num> to -1 will go to
    active workspace on <scr>. 'query_workspace' works as before (new
    workspace is, of course, created on the active screen).
  * Fixed a typo in same_screen

2001-01-01:
  * Some extra code removed

2000-12-30:
  * Focus newly splitted frame instead of the old one
  * Added CF_WARP_WS for perhaps nicer focusing on workspace switch
    when CF_WARP is enabled.
  * Don't map tabdrag window before moving
  * Default config: Button 1 click instead of press to switch client

2000-12-28:
  * Added a few missing 'void's
  * Makefile/path setting changes

2000-12-21:
  * Better focus handling for CF_WARP (pointer should always stay
    within boundaries of the active frame)
  * Added a word on (mouse) button bindings to the manual page.

2000-12-20:
  * Added 'close_main' for closing client main window, not possible
    transients first.
  * Colormap changing fixes

2000-12-02:
  * Resize fix

2000-11-12:
  * Added bindings-sun.conf where exit and restart are bound to
    SunF36/SunF37.
  * Correctly indicate active client with multiple screens (better
    multihead support still to be written...)

2000-11-07:
  * Automatically create ~/.ion if it does not exist when trying to
    save workspaces.

2000-11-05:
  * Added CF_WARP for warping the pointer to active frame, enable
    from config.h.

2000-11-04:
  * 'query_workspace_with' now attaches client to current frame on a
    workspace if the workspace already exists.
  * Line editor cursor positioning fix

2000-10-29:
  * Added 'switch_ws_next' and 'switch_ws_prev'

2000-10-27:
  * The functions 'scrollup_compl' and 'scrolldown_compl' are now
    just 'scrollup' and 'scrolldown' (used to scroll messages as
    well).
  * Changed 'edln_bindings' section of the config file to
    'input_bindings' as 'cancel' and the scroll functions affect
    messages as well.
  * Changed warnings in query.c be displayed on screen instead of
    stderr.
  * Added 'query_function' for calling ion functions. Only simple
    functions that have no arguments from FUNTAB_MAIN are supported.
    'query_function' is bound to Mod1+F3 in the default
    configuration.
  * Included snprintf_2.2 for implementations of asprintf and
    vasprintf on platforms that don't have them.

2000-10-24:
  * Completion list wrapping
  * Added WMessage for displaying messages

2000-10-22:
  * Do not ignore base size hint to display xterm size correctly
  * Move size information window in the middle of the frame being
    resized

2000-10-16:
  * Minor pointer focusing change

2000-10-07:
  * Fixed problem with transients not getting resized

2000-10-04:
  * Fixed problems with some programs' expectations

2000-09-09:
  * Line editor cosmetic fix

2000-09-03:
  * Added goto_previous

2000-08-31:
